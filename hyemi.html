<p>On one of the earliest birthdays I can remember, my favorite aunt gave me a rabbit stuffed animal. Immediately upon receiving her I declared that her name would be “Hyemi”; a girl at my church had the name, and I remember thinking it sounded pretty, without even knowing why. I took a black Sharpie, the most permanent thing my young brain could conceive of, and scribbled my own name – in both English and Korean (the latter incorrectly – where did those extra lines come from?) – on the inside of one of Hyemi’s floppy ears, and from then on she was a part of me, and I was incomplete without her. She came with me on road trips and to sleepovers at friends’ houses; my parents would often ask, “Where’s Hyemi?” as though she were their youngest child, or a pet that they didn’t want but was now undeniably a part of the family.

It’s seventeen years later, and Hyemi has clearly aged, as she isn’t as white or soft as she was the day I got her. Most of the Sharpie on her ear has faded, too. She’s gone with me to college and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Syosset,+NY/@40.8133377,-73.5389119,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2823048424f79:0xd664337ce3794078!8m2!3d40.8262101!4d-73.502068">back</a>back, and to this day I squeeze her tightly at night, knowing that no matter where life takes me, Hyemi will be there, too.</p>
