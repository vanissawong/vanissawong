<p>On <a class="general" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-do-children-start-making-long-term-memories/">one of the earliest birthdays I can remember</a>, my favorite aunt gave me a <a class="general" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rabbit+stuffed+animal&safe=strict&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS759US761&hl=en&sxsrf=ALeKk03wuUBb68R2WdspWFC_K-r5d-1Z0A:1586240116747&source=lnms&tbm=shop&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEq7_11NXoAhXhg3IEHSIuD50Q_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1680&bih=939">rabbit stuffed animal.</a> Immediately upon receiving her I declared that her name would be <a class="general" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hye-mi">“Hyemi”</a>; a girl at my church had the name, and I remember thinking it sounded pretty, without even knowing why. I took a black Sharpie, the most permanent thing my young brain could conceive of, and scribbled my own name – in both English and Korean (the latter incorrectly – where did those extra lines come from?) – on the inside of one of Hyemi’s floppy ears, and <a class="general" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-guest-room/201407/more-just-teddy-bears">from then on she was a part of me, and I was incomplete without her.</a> She came with me on road trips and to sleepovers at friends’ houses; <a class="general" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/c9/e1/d3c9e1f28e3512726df9430b36f21cef.gif">my parents would often ask, “Where’s Hyemi?” as though she were their youngest child, or a pet that they didn’t want but was now undeniably a part of the family.</a>

It’s seventeen years later, and Hyemi has clearly aged, as she isn’t as white or soft as she was the day I got her. Most of the Sharpie on her ear has faded, too. She’s gone with me to <a class="specific" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cornell+University/@42.4534492,-76.4756914,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89d0821a6191da9d:0xf50ee64d821b9ff4!8m2!3d42.4534492!4d-76.4735027">college</a> and <a class="specific" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Syosset,+NY/@40.8133377,-73.5389119,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2823048424f79:0xd664337ce3794078!8m2!3d40.8262101!4d-73.502068">back</a>, and <a class="general" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/reader-center/adults-with-stuffed-animals.html">to this day I squeeze her tightly at night, knowing that no matter where life takes me, Hyemi will be there, too.</a></p>
