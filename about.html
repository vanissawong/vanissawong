    <h1> Memory is unreliable though in a world where the web can serve as a memory hard drive the digital space enables us to extend the experience of remembrance. Home Away From Home is an archive of the objects that remind people of home as a means to immortalize memories through digital space. It is a tool for users to experience a memory again or provide context to aid in remembrance. It is about our relationship with the physical and non-physical objects and memories attached to our ‘Home.’   </h1>
